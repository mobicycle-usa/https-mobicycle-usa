                <i><b>Mining.</b></i> Renewables are the accepted cure to curb global
                warming, however, they power just 3% of the world's energy. To meet the
                increasing global demand, experts estimate that we will need to collect
                and refine minerals at a rate that is 7000% higher than current levels.
                Where will we obtain the necessary quantities? How will refining these
                quantities affect the planet? Unless we reclaim the minerals via urban
                mining, we will mine for virgin metals. Mining at this scale will encourage
                destructive mining practices. For example, refineries poison groundwater
                systems and devastate local ecosystems. If these issues resonate with
                you, we can help motivate your upstream suppliers to adopt best practices.
                We envision a future in which the mining sector invests in desalination
                plants to reduce groundwater use, tracks super greenhouse gases released
                during the refining process and funds urban mining programs.

                <i><b>Purchases and Sales.</b></i>As intermediaries between manufacturers and consumers, electronics retailers exert considerable influence throughout the product lifecycle, impacting both its creation and post-consumer phases. Retailers are uniquely positioned to mitigate environmental issues by initiating take-back schemes or recycling programs. Retailers can play a crucial role in managing the electronics waste stream, facilitating the identification of primary contributors to eWaste. Furthermore, retailers bear the responsibility of fostering sustainability within their product selections. Retailers can should prioritize products characterized by energy efficiency, the use of recycled materials, or those that are readily recyclable upon reaching the end of their lifecycle. Through the promotion of refurbished goods and supporting electronics repair services, retailers contribute to prolonging product lifespans, thereby diminishing the environmental footprint associated with electronic goods.

                to hazardous waste disposal laws, anti-dumping regulations, and
                more. Yet, just 10% of electronic waste is recycled globally. eWaste
                degrades the natural defenses within our environment. When
