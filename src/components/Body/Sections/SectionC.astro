              Did you know your supply chain generates as much as 80% of your total greenhouse gas emissions?</p>
            <p class="text-2xl md:text-2xl text-purple-650 font-light">
              Or that electronic waste is the world's fastest growing waste stream?</p>

          <p class="text-lg text-purple-650 font-normal">Greenhouse emissions from your supply chain are known as "Scope 3". Our platform helps you manage the Scope 3 emissions, biodiversity loss and pollution created by your electronics and electricals.</p>

          <p class="text-md text-purple-650 font-normal"><b>Please note:</b> We do not physically handle waste.</p>

          <p class="text-purple-650"><i><b>Mining.</b></i> Renewables are the accepted cure to curb global warming. Estimates suggest we need 2000 to 7000% more minerals to fully transition to a green economy. Yet, just 3% of the world's energy comes from renewables. Where can we obtain the quantity of materials necessary for the transition? Unless we reclaim the minerals used to power renewables, we will mine for them. Mining at this scale will destroy our planet. Groundwater systems will be poisoned. Local ecosystems will be devastated. MobiCycle's platform helps your organization support the green transition by supporting another transition away from traditional mining to urban mining.  </p>

          <p class="text-purple-650"><i><b>Manufacturing.</b></i>The manufacturing processes for electronics and electricals create extremely potent greenhouse gases.  When compared over a 100-year period, sulfur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) has a global warming potential 24 thousand times that of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>) is 17 thousand times greater.  Get meaningful, actionable data about the environmental impact of your microelectronics or semiconductor devices - from your flat-panel displays and photovoltaics to cell phones or computers, to batteries for your corporate electric vehicles.</p>

          <p class="text-purple-650"><i><b>Purchases and Sales.</b></i> The purchase and sale of electronics triggers a range of requirements around Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and more. Most guidance leaves most CEOs questioning where their organization's responsibility begins and ends. Our tools pinpoint areas where your EE supply chain directly impacts the environment. From consulting, to marketing and even games, our services enable your workforce to understand the main issues in a quick and painless manner.</p>

          <p class="text-purple-650"><i><b>Disposals.</b> </i>Broken or outdated electronics are subject to hazardous waste disposal laws, anti-dumping regulations, and more. Yet, just 10% of electronic waste is recycled globally. eWaste degrades the natural defenses within our environment. When improperly treated, eWaste pollutes our air, soil and waterways. A weakened ecosystem has a negative impact on biodiversity. We need these defenses to fight climate change. Our digital solutions provide insight into where your eWaste really goes. Use our specialty eWaste containers protect your abandoned electronics from erosion and damage, making reuse more likely.<br></p>
