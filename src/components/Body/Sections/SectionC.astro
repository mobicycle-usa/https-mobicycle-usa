            <i><b>Mining.</b></i> Renewables are the accepted cure to curb global
            warming, however, they power just 3% of the world's energy. To meet the
            increasing global demand, experts estimate that we will need to collect
            and refine minerals at a rate that is 7000% higher than current levels.
            Where will we obtain the necessary quantities? How will refining these
            quantities affect the planet? Unless we reclaim the minerals via urban
            mining, we will mine for virgin metals. Mining at this scale will encourage
            destructive mining practices. For example, refineries poison groundwater
            systems and devastate local ecosystems. If these issues resonate with
            you, we can help motivate your upstream suppliers to adopt best practices.
            We envision a future in which the mining sector invests in desalination
            plants to reduce groundwater use, tracks super greenhouse gases released
            during the refining process and funds urban mining programs.

            to hazardous waste disposal laws, anti-dumping regulations, and
            more. Yet, just 10% of electronic waste is recycled globally. eWaste
            degrades the natural defenses within our environment. When
            improperly treated, eWaste pollutes our air, soil and waterways. A
            weakened ecosystem has a negative impact on biodiversity. We need
            these defenses to fight climate change. Our digital solutions
            provide insight into where your eWaste really goes. Use our
